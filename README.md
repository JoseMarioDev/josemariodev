### Hi there üëã

I'm an AWS certified professional and full-stack developer in Chicago. I specialize in JavaScript, Python, and cloud services. I'm a graduate of [Lambda School's web development program](https://www.lambdaschool.com), where I learned software development and CS fundamentals by working in teams to build real world projects.

I have over 10 years experience in the insurance and service industries in a management capacity. Over that time I've developed critical-thinking, organizational, and communication skills.

I‚Äôm looking for an opportunity where I can put my abilities to work for a mission I‚Äôm passionate about.

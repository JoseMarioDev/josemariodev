### Hi there üëã

I'm a cloud certified developer in Chicago with an interest in full-stack development. I specialize in JavaScript, Python, and Cloud technologies. I'm a graduate of Lambda School. I was enrolled in the web development program where I learned web development and CS fundamentals by working in teams to build real world projects.

I have over 10 years experience in the insurance and service industries in a management capacity. Over that time I've developed critical-thinking, organizational, and communication skills. I‚Äôm interested in combining these skills with software development technologies to work on projects I'm passionate about.

I‚Äôm looking for an opportunity where I can put my abilities to work for a mission I‚Äôm passionate about.

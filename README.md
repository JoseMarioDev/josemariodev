### Hi there üëã

I'm a cloud certified developer in Chicago with an interest in front-end development. I specialize in JavaScript, Python, and Cloud technologies

I have over 10 years experience in the insurance and service industries in a management capacity. Over that time I've developed critical-thinking, organizational, and communication skills. I‚Äôm interested in combining these skills with software development technologies to work on projects I'm passionate about.

Check out my portfolio. https://www.josemario.dev/

**_Background._**
I am a full-stack developer in Chicago and graduate of Lambda School. I was enrolled in the web development program where I learned web development and CS fundamentals by working in teams to build real world projects.

I have previous experience in the insurance and service industries in a management capacity. I‚Äôm looking for an opportunity where I can put my abilities to work for a mission I‚Äôm passionate about.

**_What it's like working with me._** I allow people to show me their best, reveal to me their dreams, and my instinct is to take the ride with them, asking one question after another, each question carrying them along a little further, a little faster.

**_Interests._** System Design Engineering, Data Intensive Applications & Distributed Systems.

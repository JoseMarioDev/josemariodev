### Hi there üëã

I'm an Technical Account Manager at AWS. I'm a graduate of AWS' TechU program and am 3x AWS certified. I have a strong foundation of knowledge around AWS cloud services and the cloud ecosystem.

I'm a graduate of [Lambda School's web development program](https://www.lambdaschool.com), where I learned software development and CS fundamentals by working in teams to build real world projects.  I have over 10 years experience in customer service and management. Over that time I've developed critical-thinking, organizational, and communication skills.
